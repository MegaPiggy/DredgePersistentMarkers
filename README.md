# DREDGE Persistent Markers

Markers will display consistently, without the need of equipping your Spyglass.

Also makes the drop-off harsher for how soon icons disappear from view when looking away (otherwise it's annoying)

Port of [RamuneNeptune's BepInEx mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/dredge/mods/7) to [Winch](https://dredgemods.com/mods/winch/)
